# Data Structures

### Included in this repository are the projects from my data structures class.

All of the custom made data structures I implemented in C++.
Many of the datastructures are built on top of each other.
There are two applications of certain data structures, namely the infix arithmetic calculator and the maze generator.

The infix calculator takes a string of infix arithmetic, tokenizes the string, converts the tokens to postfix order, and calculates the postfix expression using a stack.

The Maze Generator, uses a disjoint set to randomly generate a unique m x n maze, that has a single path solution. Below is an example of a maze generated by the program.
